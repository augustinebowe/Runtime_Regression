The Relationship Between Movie Runtime and Box Office
Abstract
The goal of this project is to see what effect the runtime of a movie has on a movie’s box office in order to better inform movie studios on how long their feature films should be.  A Lasso regression model shows that there is a positive correlation between runtime and box office performance across different genres, even while controlling for other relevant factors.
Data
The data used in this project is the top 200 grossing movies from each year from 2015 to 2019.  The data was scraped from boxofficemojo.com and parsed using beautiful soup.  
Algorithms
Feature Engineering
1. Polynomial terms for continuous variables
2. Interaction terms between budget, runtime, genres, distributors and MPAA rating
3. Films missing a budget were assigned the median budget of the rest of the dataset
Models
Linear Regression was used as the first iteration, but a Lasso regression was used to reduce model variance and exclude variables with little predictive value
Model Evaluation and Selection
The dataset of 100 movies was broken into a training set of 800 lines and a testing set of 200 lines.  The model was cross-validated on 5 folds of the training set.  The cross-validation process yielded an alpha value of 615,098.  After the model was refined, it was tested on the final testing set, and the Mean Absolute Error on this test was $95,724,302.
The model’s coefficients for runtime (29,351,259), runtime of comedy (-39,388,815) and runtime of action (45,355,300), when unscaled, predict an increase in box office for movies of every genre with an increase in runtime.
